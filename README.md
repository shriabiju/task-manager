# TaskZen – Project & Task Management Application

TaskZen is a **Java Swing-based desktop application** developed to help users efficiently manage **projects, tasks, deadlines, and priorities** through a clean, organized, and interactive dashboard interface.

This project was created as an **academic mini project / internal submission** to demonstrate the practical implementation of **Java GUI development**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, modular architecture, and event-driven programming.

## 📌 Project Overview

TaskZen provides a centralized workspace where users can:

- Create and manage multiple **projects**
- Add and organize **tasks** under each project
- Assign **deadlines**
- Set **priority levels**
- Mark tasks as **completed**
- Delete tasks and projects
- View work in a structured and user-friendly interface

The application follows a **modular design approach**, separating:

- **User Interface**
- **Business Logic**
- **Data Models**

This improves the project's **readability, maintainability, and scalability**.

📂 Module Description
1. main Package
Main.java

This is the entry point of the application.

Responsibilities:

Launches the GUI using SwingUtilities.invokeLater()
Initializes the main application window
Ensures safe execution on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)
2. model Package

This package contains the data model classes used in the application.

Project.java

Represents a project that contains:

Project name
List of tasks

Functions include:

Add task
Delete task
Get task list
Count completed and pending tasks
Task.java

Represents an individual task with:

Task title
Deadline
Priority
Completion status

Functions include:

Mark task as completed
Mark task as pending
Access and modify task details
3. service Package
TaskService.java

This is the business logic layer of the application.

Responsibilities:

Manage all projects
Add and delete projects
Add and delete tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Fetch tasks for the selected project
Maintain task counts

This class acts as the bridge between:

UI Layer
Data Models
4. ui Package

This package contains all graphical user interface components.

MainFrame.java

The main application window.

Responsibilities:

Builds the dashboard layout
Integrates:
ProjectPanel
TaskPanel
Displays:
App title
Welcome section
Live date and time
ProjectPanel.java

Responsible for managing project-related operations.

Features:

Display available projects
Add new projects
Delete existing projects
Update task view on project selection
TaskPanel.java

Responsible for task-related operations.

Features:

Add new tasks
Set:
Title
Date
Time
Priority

This panel serves as the main working area of the application.

🖥️ User Interface Design

The application follows a dashboard-style desktop interface to provide a cleaner and more modern user experience.

UI Components Included
Sidebar navigation
Project workspace list
Task input form
Task list display
Action buttons
Date and time card
Custom fonts, colors, spacing, and layouts
Design Goals

⚙️ Working of the Application
Step 1 – Launch the Application

When the application starts:

The main window opens
Default projects are displayed:
Personal
Work
College
Step 2 – Select a Project

The user selects a project from the sidebar.

Once selected:

Tasks belonging to that project are loaded into the main panel
Step 3 – Add a Task

The user enters:
